2048cpp
=======

2048 game written in C++

compile: make

To create a 2048 game that post the result to a server:
Create a header file: standard.h , add following defines with some values:
* #define STANDARD_URL 
* #define STANDARD_PREFIX
Run: make online

This was made for OSX but should work just as fine on any Linux machine.

I hope somebody find it useful or fun.
